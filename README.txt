Mixed Messages

This project is for a random message generator program.
Every time a user runs the program they will get a new random message.

I created the program using JavaScript as a portfolio project from Codecademy Full-Stack career path.
I chose to create random inspirational & motivational messages.

The code uses random strings to 'fill in the blanks' of a certain phrase.
For example-
"Let this day be a new start"
The first part- "Let this day" is constant, however the rest of the sentence is randomized.
